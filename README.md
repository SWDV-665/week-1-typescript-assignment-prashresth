### Week1

#### Instructions

- Create a file called grocery.ts. It should have a definition of a class with 
  the obvious name Grocery. The class should have some basic attributes such as
  name, quantity, etc. Feel free to add any other attributes you think will be necessary.
- Add few grocery items to an array of groceries, such as milk, bread, and eggs, along with
  some quantities (i.e. 3, 6, 11).  Display these grocery items as HTML output.
- The output of this assignment will be grocery.ts and groceries.html displaying the output.

#### First typescript assignment ever!!

> Simply open the `groceries.html` file on your preferred browser.

> If changes are made to `grocery.ts` then, make sure to run `tsc grocery.ts` to compile the
> type script file into a javascript file.
> 
> NOTE: maybe require running `npm install -g typescript` for the compiling `.ts` files if you 
> do not have typescript installed on your machine
